This project's purpose is to utilise agentic approach to assit customer find details about their exisiting lenovo or moto devices or enquire about lastest devices using the internet.

The development process I used:

phase 1 was to build an agent that does this work when invoked seprately

phase 2 was to build that backend that listens to a local address and has post req and the agent as function

And in phase 3 was to create requirement.txt, change port number, specify entry point and deploy the application on Render
